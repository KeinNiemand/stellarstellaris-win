# StellarStellars - Windows (+Linux?) edition

The goal of this project is to start building an enhanced version of StellarStellaris that can hook into Stellaris on multiple platforms, with the initial focus being Steam Windows, since that is the most heavily used version.

This is in a very early alpha stage, it currently doesn't do much of anything.

## Goals:

1. Hook a DLL Payload into Stellaris
2. Identify locations of useful memory structures
3. Hook a LUA interpreter into a console command
4. ???
5. Replace CGalaxyGenerator with LUA code
